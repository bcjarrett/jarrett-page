		Another simple project one could hypothetically use to efficiently monitor craigslist for newly
		posted deals. This tool support a variety of different user-defined queries and stores everything
		in a sqlite database queried with sqlalchemy. One could theoretically define and monitor a specific
		bounding box for new apartment listings or used car sales within a certain price range.
