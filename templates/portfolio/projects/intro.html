		with roughly 10 years professional experience. I have personal and professional development and IT experience
		with a number of tools and technologies:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Full-stack web development</li>
		<li>SQL database management</li>
		<li>GIS data processing</li>
		<li>AWS hosting and deployment</li>
		<li>Legacy VBA and Access support</li>

	<p>
		From 2017-2021, I worked for and owned part of a small drone startup, Geomatix, where I wore a
		number of hats.	I spend a good amount of time in the field, a lot of time processing CAD and GIS data,
		and a fair amount of time managing the full customer lifecycle of all our clients from marketing to invoicing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I put this site together to showcase some projects I'm proud of in hopes of impressing someone who wants me on
		their team. Thanks for visiting.
