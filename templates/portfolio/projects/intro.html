	<h2 class="card-title">About Me</h2>
	<p class="card-text">
		My name is Ben Jarrett, I currently reside in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I'm a full-stack developer with
		roughly 10 years professional experience. I have personal and professional development experience in a number
		of fields:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Full-stack web development</li>
		<li>SQL database management</li>
		<li>GIS data processing</li>
		<li>AWS hosting and deployment</li>
		<li>Legacy VBA and Access support</li>
		<li>Windows system deployment</li>
		<li>CRM administration</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For the past three years, I've been working for small drone startup, Geomatix, where I wore a
		number of hats.	I spend a good amount of time in the field, a lot of time processing CAD and GIS data with
		third-party and self made tools, and a fair amount of time managing the full customer lifecycle of all our
		clients	from marketing to invoicing.
