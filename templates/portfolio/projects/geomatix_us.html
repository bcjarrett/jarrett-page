		This project is similar to the website you're viewing right now, in a technical sense. There
		are a handful of differences, like the ability to sign up for blog post notifications, or the addition of an
		ad-hoc blog manager, or freelance pilot registration, or google add integration... but most importantly,
		every piece of content on the linked site was generated by yours truly.
