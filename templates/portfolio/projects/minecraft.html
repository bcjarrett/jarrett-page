	<h2 class="card-title">Minecraft Server Hosting</h2>
	<p class="card-text">
		In my spare time I like to game with friends. I'm not a huge Minecraft fan, but I thought it would be
		a fun exercise to build out a hosting platform for our shared server. This project is another django app
		adapted from an opensource flask app. Hosted on my personal website, it allows me and my friends access to
		a tool that can affordably manage and host new or stored minecraft instances.
	</p>
	<p class="card-text">
		This app is capable of provisioning new EC2 instances, setting them up with a standard AMI,
		installing and configuring the newest version of minecraft, and returning a public IP address for
		client connection. It also allows users to spin-down instances at will, and automatically turns off running EC2
		instances after a set amount of inactivity.
